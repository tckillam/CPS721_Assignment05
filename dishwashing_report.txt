%%%%% SECTION: cpu_details
%%%%% Describe the system you ran your tests on below.
%%%%% It should include information about the processor (mainly speed), 
%%%%% amount of RAM, and operator system you ran your tests on.

% Processor: Apple M1 (ARM-based), 8-core CPU
% RAM: 8 GB (hw.memsize: 8,589,934,592 bytes)
% Operating System: macOS 14.5 (Sonoma), BuildVersion 23F79



%%%%% SECTION: summary
%%%%% Summarize your results in 5-10 sentences. Describe which states you tested on, 
%%%%% which ones ran in a reasonable amount of time (and how long they took), and 
%%%%% how much speedup you saw when using declarative heuristics. Report any other 
%%%%% interesting behaviour you saw.

Goals 11–15 (Init1): Regular mode solved Goal 11 very quickly (0.00 seconds) but struggled with Goals 12–15, taking longer or failing. Heuristic mode was faster, solving Goal 11 at the same speed and determining that Goals 12–15 couldn’t be solved in less time (0.60–0.90 seconds).

Goals 21–22 (Init2): Both modes handled Goal 21 efficiently, with regular mode taking 0.01–0.04 seconds and heuristic mode performing slightly faster. For Goal 22, regular mode took 2.02 seconds to fail, while heuristic mode determined it was unsolvable in just 0.90 seconds.

Goal 31 (Init3): Regular mode failed after 1.31 seconds, but heuristic mode found it unsolvable in 0.63 seconds, showing better performance.

heuristic mode was faster and better at identifying unsolvable problems. Regular mode worked well for simpler cases but struggled with harder ones.




%%%%% SECTION: log
%%%%% Show the actual queries you ran below, along with the output
%%%%% This should include runtime and the actual plan found
